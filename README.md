### FAQ

Q. The search field in the JCE link manager does not return any K2 content
A. The search field uses the Joomla "K2 Search" plugin, the same one used to search the site in the front-end. This must be enabled in JCE Editor Profiles -> Plugin Parameters -> Link (tab), in the "Search" section (scroll to the bottom of the page).


### COMPATIBILITY

The minimum requirements to use the plugin are:

- JCE 2.6.x (or newer)
- K2 2.8.x (or newer)
- Joomla 3.x
