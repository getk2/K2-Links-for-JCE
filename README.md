K2 Links for JCE
=========

This JCE 2.6.x compatible extension allows you to quickly link any part of your content to K2 items, categories, tags and users, directly from within the WYSIWYG editor window. Once installed, whenever you create a new link using JCE's link options, you'll see available link actions specifically for K2 content.

### FEATURES
A JCE plugin that allows linking to K2 content from the links panel in JCE.

### DEMO & SHOWCASE
This is a backend extension so a public demo or showcase is currently not available.

### REQUIREMENTS
This is a JCE extension and the only basic requirements to use it are:

- JCE v2.6.x
- K2 v2.6.x or newer (preferrably v2.7.x+)
- Joomla v3.x

The latest version should work on all Joomla releases from version 2.5 to 3.x. Support for Joomla 1.5 is no longer available.

### FAQ
Q. The search field in the JCE link manager does not return any K2 content
A. The search field uses the Joomla K2 Search plugin, the same one used to search the site in the front-end. This must be enabled in JCE Editor Profiles -> Plugin Parameters -> Link, in the Search section (scroll to the bottom of the page).

### LICENSE
