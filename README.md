K2 Links for JCE
=========================

This JCE 2.6.x compatible extension allows you to quickly link any part of your content to K2 items, categories, tags and users, directly from within the WYSIWYG editor window. Once installed, whenever you create a new link using JCE's link options, you'll see available link actions specifically for K2 content.

### FEATURES
A JCE plugin that allows linking to K2 content from the links panel in JCE.

### DEMO & SHOWCASE

### REQUIREMENTS
This is a JCE extension and the minimum requirements to use it are:

- JCE 2.6.x
- K2 2.8.x
- Joomla 3.x

Support for Joomla 1.5 & 2.5 is no longer available.

### FAQ
Q. The search field in the JCE link manager does not return any K2 content
A. The search field uses the Joomla "K2 Search" plugin, the same one used to search the site in the front-end. This must be enabled in JCE Editor Profiles -> Plugin Parameters -> Link (tab), in the "Search" section (scroll to the bottom of the page).
